# Build AI agents with portal

In this exercise, you'll build an AI agent solution using a Microsoft Foundry project that has already been deployed and prepared for the lab. You'll create and configure an agent in the Foundry portal, then interact with it from Visual Studio Code by using the Foundry Toolkit extension and a Python client application.

This exercise takes approximately **45** minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- Access to the Microsoft Foundry project prepared by your trainer or lab environment
- Permission to create and configure agents in that project
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your local machine
- [Python 3.12 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your local machine
- Basic familiarity with Azure AI services and Python programming
- Install Azure CLI using the link- https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows

> **Important:** The Microsoft Foundry project, resource, region, subscription, and deployed model are already provided. **Do not** create a new project or resource, deploy another model, or change the existing project settings. Use the provided project and continue by configuring the agent.

## Open the existing Microsoft Foundry project

Microsoft Foundry projects organize models, resources, data, and other assets used to develop an AI solution. For this lab, use the existing project prepared by your trainer or lab environment. Do **not** create a new project, Foundry resource, or model deployment.

1. Open the **Microsoft Foundry portal** at `https://ai.azure.com`. If you are not already signed in, select **Sign in** and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick-start panes that appear.

   > **Note:** If Foundry displays the **All resources** page, select the existing project provided for this lab. In this example, the project is named `hakunamatata1`.

## Configure your agent with instructions and grounding data

The agent will act as a **Credit Risk Assessment Agent**. It will use uploaded company documents as grounding data and use **Code interpreter** to analyze financial information and calculate the required credit-risk metrics.

### 1. Configure the agent instructions

In the agent playground, set **Instructions** to:

```prompt
You are a Credit Risk Assessment Agent.

You assess the credit risk of client companies using the documents and financial information provided to you.

Follow these guidelines:

- Verify that both the Company Registration Certificate and GST Certificate are available.
- Compare the client company name with the name shown on both certificates. The names must match exactly.
- Check the company's legal status and identify whether it is Active or Inactive.
- Review sanctions, watchlists, and adverse compliance information when such data is provided.
- Confirm that audited or summarized financial statements are available for the last two financial years.
- Use the latest financial year to calculate Current Ratio, Debt-to-Equity, and Net Profit Margin.
- Use the provided external credit bureau score when available.
- Assign the Industry Risk Rating using the provided Industry Risk Matrix.
- Apply the provided credit-risk scorecard consistently.
- Clearly show the evidence used for each assessment.
- Do not invent missing information. If required information is unavailable, clearly state that it could not be verified.
- Provide the final risk rating, recommended credit limit, and payment terms only when the required information is available.
- Keep the assessment professional, concise, and easy for a credit analyst to review.
```

### 2. Add the credit-risk grounding document

Download the **[textfiles.zip](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FKiran-255666%2FAgenticAIEngineer%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Ftextfiles)** file and extract the ZIP file.

The grounding material (i.e., ****Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt***) contains the assessment process, including:

* Required company documents
* Company-name verification rules
* Legal-status checks
* Sanctions and adverse compliance checks
* Financial-statement requirements
* Current Ratio calculation
* Debt-to-Equity calculation
* Net Profit Margin calculation
* External credit bureau scoring
* Industry Risk Matrix
* Final 100-point scorecard
* Credit-limit and payment-term recommendations

> **Note:** This document provides the rules the agent should follow when performing a credit-risk assessment. The agent should use the document as grounding data rather than relying only on its general knowledge.

### 3. Enable File search

Return to the agent playground.

1. In the **Tools** section, select **Add**. Under **Most Popular**, select **File search**.

   **Tip:** If **File search** is not displayed under **Most Popular**, select **Add** again, choose **Add tools**, select **File search** under **Configured**, and then select **Add tool**.

   ![Screenshot of the File search tool.](../../media/04-03-06.png)

2. After adding **File search**, you will be redirected to a page where you can create or select a vector index.

3. Under **Vector index name**, enter:

   ```text
   credit-risk-assessment-index
   ```

4. Under ****Drag and drop files here or browse for files****, upload ****Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt****, which you downloaded earlier.

5. After attaching the file, verify that its status shows **Success**, and then select **Attach**.

6. Wait for the file to be indexed before continuing.

### 4. Enable Code interpreter

1. In the **Tools** section, select **Add**. Under **Most Popular**, select **Code interpreter** and toggle it on.

2. The `textfiles` folder, which you downloaded earlier as part of the lab, already contains the following file:

   ```text
   Forumlas.txt
   ```

   This file contains the calculation rules for:

   ```text
   Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

   Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity

   Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100
   ```

   It also specifies that the **latest available financial year** should be used for these calculations.

3. In the **Code interpreter** section, select **+ Files** and upload `Forumlas.txt` from the `textfiles` folder using **Drag and drop files here** or **browse for files**.

4. Verify that the file status shows **Success**, then select **Attach**.

The Code interpreter can now use these calculation rules when analyzing the financial data.

### 5. Upload the financial data

1. Use the `financial_data.csv` file that you downloaded earlier as part of the lab.

2. The file contains the financial information required to calculate the credit-risk metrics for the latest financial year, including:

   * Current Assets
   * Current Liabilities
   * Total Debt
   * Shareholders' Equity
   * Revenue
   * Net Profit
   * External Credit Bureau Score
   * Industry

3. To the right of **Code interpreter**, select **+ Files**.

4. Upload `financial_data.csv` using **Drag and drop files here** or **browse for files**.

5. After attaching the file, verify that the status shows **Success**, then select **Attach**.

   **Note:** The agent will use the uploaded financial data together with the calculation rules to calculate and analyze the required credit-risk metrics.

### 6. Save the agent

1. Select **Save** to save the configured credit-risk agent.

## Test your credit-risk agent

Test the agent to confirm that it can retrieve information from the grounding documents and use Code interpreter for financial analysis.

> **Note:** The agent's response may not match the examples word-for-word. Responses can vary depending on the model and context. Verify that the response contains the expected information, calculations, and reasoning described in each test.

### Verify the required documents

1. In the playground chat pane, enter:

```text
Verify whether the Company Registration Certificate and GST Certificate are available for the client. Compare the client company name with the company name shown on both certificates and confirm whether the names match exactly.
```

2. Review the response.

The agent should verify that both required documents are available and that the company names match exactly.

If either document is missing, or the company name does not match, the agent should clearly state that the document verification or compliance check fails. It should not assume that a missing document is available.

### 2. Test the credit-risk assessment rules

1. Enter:

```text
Using the exact rules in Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt, what checks must be completed before assigning a credit risk rating? Summarize the required checks and scoring areas defined in the file.
```

2. Review the response.

The response should cover the main assessment areas defined in `Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt`, including:

* Document verification
* Company-name matching
* MCA legal status
* Sanctions and compliance screening
* Financial statements
* Financial ratios
* External credit bureau score
* Industry risk
* Credit-risk scorecard
* Final risk classification

The exact wording or order may differ, but the response should be consistent with the rules provided in `Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt`.

### 3. Test financial calculations with Code interpreter

1. Enter:

```text
Use Code Interpreter to access the uploaded file named financial_data.csv.

First, open and read the CSV file directly using Code Interpreter. Do not use File Search to retrieve the CSV data.

Identify the latest Financial_Year in the file and use that row for the calculation. Extract these exact columns:
- Current_Assets
- Current_Liabilities
- Total_Debt
- Shareholders_Equity
- Revenue
- Net_Profit

Then calculate the following using the formulas provided in Formulas.txt:
- Current Ratio = Current_Assets / Current_Liabilities
- Debt-to-Equity = Total_Debt / Shareholders_Equity
- Net Profit Margin = (Net_Profit / Revenue) × 100

Show the latest financial year, extracted values, formulas, and final calculated results. Do not assume, invent, or estimate any values. If the CSV cannot be accessed, clearly state that the file could not be read.
```

2. The agent should use **Code interpreter** to open and process `financial_data.csv`.

3. Review the response.

The response should identify the latest financial year and show the extracted financial values used for the calculations.

For the provided `financial_data.csv`, the latest financial year is **2025**.

The calculations should be based on the formulas in `Formulas.txt`:

```text
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity

Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100
```

The agent should show the calculation steps and final values. The numerical presentation may vary slightly due to rounding, but the results should be consistent with the uploaded CSV data.

### 4. Test the Industry Risk Matrix

1. Enter:

```text
Use the exact rules in Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt to determine the client's industry risk.

First, identify the client's Industry from the uploaded financial_data.csv. Then use the Industry Risk Matrix provided in Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt to determine the applicable risk category and score.

State:
- Company name
- Industry
- Industry risk category
- Industry risk score
- Brief explanation of how the industry maps to the Industry Risk Matrix

Do not use general knowledge or assume an industry risk rating. If the industry or required information is unavailable, clearly state that it could not be determined.
```

2. Review the response.

The agent should identify the client's industry from `financial_data.csv` and use the Industry Risk Matrix from `Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt`.

For the provided data:

```text
Company: Contoso Manufacturing Ltd
Industry: Manufacturing
Risk Category: Medium Risk
Industry Score: 8
```

The agent should explain that **Manufacturing** is listed under **Medium Risk** in the Industry Risk Matrix and therefore receives **8 points**.

### 5. Generate the final credit-risk assessment

1. Enter:

```text
Using the exact rules in Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt and the financial data in financial_data.csv, complete the credit-risk assessment for the client.

Use Code Interpreter to read financial_data.csv and calculate the Current Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, and Net Profit Margin using the formulas in Formulas.txt.

Use the latest financial year available in financial_data.csv.

Apply the scoring rules exactly as defined in Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt.

Show:
- Document verification result
- Company name match result
- MCA legal status
- Sanctions and compliance screening result
- Financial ratios and calculations
- D&B credit score
- Industry risk category and score
- Score for each credit-risk scorecard category
- Total score out of 100
- Final risk rating
- Recommended credit limit
- Recommended payment terms

Clearly explain how each score was calculated. Do not invent, assume, or estimate missing company information. If required information is unavailable, clearly identify it and do not assign a score based on an assumption.
```

2. Review the response.

The agent should combine information from:

* `Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt` for the assessment and scoring rules
* `Formulas.txt` for the financial calculation formulas
* `financial_data.csv` for the client's financial data

The scorecard defined in `Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt` contains:

| Category                          | Maximum Score |
| --------------------------------- | ------------: |
| Compliance                        |            20 |
| Liquidity (Current Ratio)         |            20 |
| Leverage (Debt-to-Equity)         |            15 |
| Profitability (Net Profit Margin) |            15 |
| External Credit Bureau            |            15 |
| Industry Risk                     |            15 |
| **Total**                         |       **100** |

3. Verify that the agent explains how each score was calculated and uses only the available evidence.

> **Note:** The final response may be formatted differently or use different wording. The important point is that the agent applies the rules from `Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt`, uses the financial data from `financial_data.csv`, uses the formulas from `Formulas.txt`, and does not invent missing information.

### 6. Request a visualization

1. Enter:

```text
Use Code Interpreter to read the uploaded financial_data.csv and create a chart showing the company's Current Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, and Net Profit Margin for the latest financial year.

Use the formulas provided in Formulas.txt to calculate the three metrics before creating the chart.
```

2. The agent should use **Code interpreter** to read the financial data, calculate the metrics, and generate a suitable visualization.

3. Review the visualization.

The chart should represent the Current Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, and Net Profit Margin calculated from the latest financial year in `financial_data.csv`.

> **Note:** The chart style, layout, labels, and presentation may vary. The important point is that the visualization is based on the uploaded financial data and the calculations defined in `Formulas.txt`.

## Understand the complete credit-risk flow

The agent combines document grounding, financial analysis, and the credit-risk scorecard into a single assessment workflow.

## Summary

You used an existing Microsoft Foundry project and its deployed model to create a **Credit Risk Assessment Agent**.

You:

* Configured the agent with credit-risk assessment instructions.
* Grounded the agent with `Credit_Risk_Assessment_Rules.txt` using **File search**.
* Used `Formulas.txt` to define the required financial calculations.
* Used **Code interpreter** to read and analyze `financial_data.csv`.
* Verified required company documents and company-name consistency.
* Calculated Current Ratio, Debt-to-Equity, and Net Profit Margin using the latest financial year.
* Applied the Industry Risk Matrix and 100-point credit-risk scorecard.
* Combined compliance, financial, bureau, and industry information into a structured assessment.
* Tested the agent with document verification, financial analysis, industry risk, scoring, and visualization prompts.
* Generated a visualization from the financial data using **Code interpreter**.

This demonstrates how a Microsoft Foundry agent can combine **grounded business rules, financial data, calculations, and structured scoring rules** to support a practical credit-risk assessment workflow.

# Fine-tune a language model

**Prompt engineering** means giving a language model instructions for a specific task or conversation. For example, you can tell a model, *"Act as a credit analyst and explain your decision with the key factors."* The model follows those instructions for that interaction.

**Fine-tuning** is different. Instead of relying only on instructions, you provide the model with example inputs and the responses you expect. The model learns those patterns and can follow the desired behavior more consistently.

### Real-world example

Imagine a bank wants an AI assistant to review business loan applications. You could give it examples showing how to assess:

* Company documents
* Compliance requirements
* Financial ratios
* Credit history
* Industry risk

For example, if a company's financial information is incomplete, the training examples can show the assistant that it should **identify the missing information instead of making assumptions**.

In this exercise, you will build a **credit risk management assistant** that follows this type of assessment consistently.

## What you will do

1. **Test the prepared `gpt-5.4-mini` model** in the playground and observe how it responds to credit-risk scenarios.
2. **Create a supervised fine-tuning job** using `gpt-4.1` and the provided training data.
3. **Test the fine-tuned model** and compare its responses with the prepared base model.

The goal is to understand how example-based training can make a model's behavior more consistent for a specific use case.

This exercise takes approximately **90 minutes**.

> **Note:** Fine-tuning depends on cloud capacity and can take 60 minutes or longer. Some portal features are in preview or under active development, so you may see warnings or unexpected behavior. You can continue with the playground-testing tasks while the job runs.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have:

- An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- A web browser
- A Microsoft Foundry project prepared by your trainer or lab environment
- The **gpt-5.4-mini** model available for the initial playground test
- The **gpt-4.1** model available for the supervised fine-tuning job
- Permission to create fine-tuning jobs and upload datasets

> The project and required models are already prepared for this exercise. Do not create a new project or add another base model.

# Verify the existing project

Microsoft Foundry projects organize the models, resources, data, and other assets used to build an AI solution.

1. Open the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in with your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick-start panes that appear.
1. On the home page, select the project prepared by your trainer or lab environment.
1. Open the model playground and confirm that the prepared **gpt-5.4-mini** model is available.

    > **Tip**: If you cannot find the project or gpt-5.4-mini, check with your trainer before continuing.

# Download the training data

1. Open the [training dataset](https://github.com/Kiran-255666/AgenticAIEngineer/blob/main/labfiles/Day03/lab04-fine-tuning/credit_risk_management.jsonl) in a browser.
1. Download the file and save it locally as `credit_risk_management.jsonl`.

    > **Important**: Your browser may save the file with a `.txt` extension. If it does, rename the file so that its name ends in `.jsonl`.

# Test gpt-5.4-mini in the playground

While the fine-tuning job runs, test the prepared **gpt-5.4-mini** model and note how prompt instructions affect its behavior.

1. Open the model playground for **gpt-5.4-mini**.

2. In the chat pane, enter:

   ```text
   What can you do?
   ```

   The response may be generic. The credit risk application needs more specific behavior focused on business credit assessment.

3. In the **Instructions** field, enter:

   ```text
   You are an AI assistant that helps assess the creditworthiness of business clients.
   ```

4. Ask the same question again:

   ```text
   What can you do?
   ```

   The assistant may provide a general response. The credit risk application requires more specific behavior and should focus on document verification, compliance checks, financial analysis, external credit information, and industry risk.

5. Replace the instructions with the following prompt:

   ```text
   You are an AI credit risk management assistant that helps assess the creditworthiness of business clients. Your objective is to evaluate company documents, compliance status, financial ratios, external credit information, and industry risk using the provided credit risk assessment rules.
   Do not invent missing financial or compliance information.
   Clearly identify missing documents or data and explain how they affect the assessment.
   ```

6. Test the model with these questions. Note the answers, tone, and writing style:

   ```text
   What documents are required to start a credit risk assessment?
   ```

   ```text
   The client uploaded only the GST Certificate. Can we pass the document verification step?
   ```

   ```text
   A company has a Current Ratio of 1.56, Debt-to-Equity of 1.86, and Net Profit Margin of 5.56%. How many points does it receive for these three financial metrics?
   ```

   ```text
   How does industry risk affect the credit score?
   ```

   ```text
   What happens if a sanctions or compliance match is confirmed?
   ```

# Review the training data

The training file contains examples of the behavior and writing style that you want the fine-tuned model to learn.

1. Open the downloaded `credit_risk_management.jsonl` file in a text editor.

2. Review the JSONL entries. The first entry should look similar to the following example, formatted for readability:

```json
{"messages": [
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are an AI credit risk management assistant that helps assess the creditworthiness of business clients. Your objective is to evaluate company documents, compliance status, financial ratios, external credit information, and industry risk using the provided credit risk assessment rules. Do not invent missing financial or compliance information. Clearly identify missing documents or data and explain how they affect the assessment."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What documents are required to start a credit risk assessment?"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "The assessment requires both the Company Registration Certificate and GST Certificate. The company name must match exactly across the client information and both certificates. The assessment should also verify the company's legal status, sanctions or adverse compliance records, financial statements for the last two financial years, and the latest external credit score or rating."
  }
]}
```

Each entry includes system instructions, a credit-risk-related user question, and an assistant response that you want the model to learn. These examples help the fine-tuned model produce more consistent credit risk assessments and follow the defined scoring rules.

# Test the fine-tuned model

1. In the left navigation, select **Fine-tune** and check the status of the job you started earlier.

2. Select the job to view its details. Open the **Logs** tab if you need to review completed tasks or errors.

![Snippet](../../media/logs.png)

1. When fine-tuning finishes, verify that the fine-tuned model is available in **Deployments**.

   > **Tip**: If automatic deployment did not finish successfully, open the completed fine-tuning job and make the fine-tuned model available from its details page.

2. Open the fine-tuned model in the model playground.

3. Set the **Instructions** field to the same credit risk management prompt used earlier:

   ```text
   You are an AI credit risk management assistant that helps assess the creditworthiness of business clients. Your objective is to evaluate company documents, compliance status, financial ratios, external credit information, and industry risk using the provided credit risk assessment rules.
   Do not invent missing financial or compliance information.
   Clearly identify missing documents or data and explain how they affect the assessment.
   ```

4. Ask the same credit risk questions again:

   ```text
   What documents are required to start a credit risk assessment?
   ```

   ```text
   The client uploaded only the GST Certificate. Can we pass the document verification step?
   ```

   ```text
   A company has a Current Ratio of 1.56, Debt-to-Equity of 1.86, and Net Profit Margin of 5.56%. How many points does it receive for these three financial metrics?
   ```

   ```text
   How does industry risk affect the credit score?
   ```

   ```text
   What happens if a sanctions or compliance match is confirmed?
   ```

5. Compare the fine-tuned model's responses with the prepared **gpt-5.4-mini** base model. Note differences in tone, consistency, adherence to the credit risk instructions, and use of the defined assessment rules.

## Summary

In this lab, you tested **gpt-5.4-mini** in the playground and saw how instructions can guide the model's responses. You then prepared a **credit risk management dataset** in JSONL format and used it to start a supervised fine-tuning job with **gpt-4.1**.

**Fine-tuning** means training a model with example conversations so it learns to respond in a more consistent way for a specific task or style. In this lab, the examples teach the model how to handle credit risk assessments, including document verification, compliance checks, financial ratios, credit scores, and industry risk.

Finally, you tested the fine-tuned model with the same credit risk questions and compared its responses with the base model.

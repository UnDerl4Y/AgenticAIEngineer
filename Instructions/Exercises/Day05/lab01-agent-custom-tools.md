# Use a custom function in an AI agent

> **Note:** We have already updated the mentioned files with the code provided in the instructions. However, we highly recommend going through the code once before executing it.

In this exercise, you'll explore how an AI agent can use custom functions as tools to perform specific tasks. These functions can be used to support different steps in a credit-risk assessment workflow, such as retrieving information, performing calculations, or generating reports. You'll define the functions, connect them to the agent, and see how the agent processes function calls and uses their results.

This exercise should take approximately **45** minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your local machine
- An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your local machine

> \* Python 3.14 is available, but some dependencies are not yet compiled for that release. The lab has been successfully tested with Python 3.13.12.

## Create a Foundry project with the Foundry Toolkit for VS Code extension

1. Before starting the lab, install ****Azure CLI**** using the following link: [https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows]. Click the link to download the installer. The download will start automatically and the installer will be available in your ****Downloads**** folder.

> If the download does not start automatically, copy and paste the link into your browser.

![Screenshot of the Azure CLI installer downloaded in the Downloads folder.](../../media/azure-cli-download.png)

2. After the download is complete, open the ****Downloads**** folder and double-click the downloaded installer. Follow the instructions shown by the installer to complete the installation.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure CLI installation setup wizard.](../../media/azure-cli-install-wizard.png)

3. Open the integrated terminal using **`Ctrl+Shift+`** and run the following command to sign in to Azure:

```powershell
az login
```

A browser window or pop-up will open asking you to sign in. If you do not see the sign-in window, minimize all open windows and tabs to check if it is open in the background. Sign in using the account provided by your trainer.

After a successful sign-in, you may see the following prompt in the terminal:

```text
Select a subscription and tenant (Type a number or Enter for no changes):
```

Type ****1**** and press ****Enter**** to select the subscription provided by your trainer.

To verify that you are successfully signed in, run:

```powershell
az account show
```

This command will display your current Azure account and subscription details.

> ****Tip:**** If you face an error during sign-in, run the following commands and try again:
>
> ```powershell
> az logout
> az login
> az account show
> ```
>
> Complete the sign-in again using the account provided by your trainer.

4. If the `az` command is not recognized, for example, `'az' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program`, Azure CLI may not have been installed correctly, or the terminal may have been opened before the installation updated the system PATH.

> ****Troubleshooting:**** Try the following steps:
>
> 1. Close and reopen the integrated terminal, then run `az login` again. If the issue persists, restart **Visual Studio Code** and try again.
>
> 2. If the error still persists, uninstall and reinstall Azure CLI using the following commands:
>
> ```powershell
> winget uninstall Microsoft.AzureCLI
> winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI
> ```
>
> 3. After the installation is complete, restart the integrated terminal and run `az login` again.


As a developer, you may spend time working in the **Microsoft Foundry portal**, but most development tasks are typically performed in **Visual Studio Code**. The **Foundry Toolkit** extension allows you to work with Foundry project resources directly within **Visual Studio Code**, so you can manage and develop your Foundry projects without leaving your development environment.

5. Open **Visual Studio Code** by typing **Code** in the Windows search bar, then click **Code** to open it.

6. Select **Extensions** from the left pane (or press **Ctrl+Shift+X**).

7. Search the Extensions Marketplace for the **Foundry Toolkit for VS Code** extension from Microsoft and select **Install**.

   ![Screenshot of the Foundry Toolkit for VS Code extension in the Extensions Marketplace.](../../media/foundry-toolkit-extension.png)

8. After installing the extension, you will see two new icons in the sidebar: ****AI Toolkit**** and ****Azure AI Foundry****. Select the ****Azure AI Foundry**** icon to view your Foundry resources directly in Visual Studio Code without opening **ai.azure.com**.

   ![Screenshot of the Foundry Toolkit sidebar showing My Resources and Developer Tools sections before sign-in.](../../media/foundry-toolkit-sidebar.png)

9. You can now directly copy the **API keys** and **endpoints** from the **Azure AI Foundry** extension in Visual Studio Code.


## Use the deployed model

Use the deployed model that's already available in your Foundry project. Right-click the name of the project deployment and select **Copy Project Endpoint**. You'll need this URL to connect your agent to the Foundry project in the next steps.

![Screenshot of copying the project endpoint in the Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension.](../../media/vs-code-endpoint.png)

# Get the application files from GitHub

1. If you have already downloaded and extracted the repository in a previous lab, delete the existing ZIP file and the extracted folder. This will allow us to use the PowerShell commands in the following steps and help avoid long path issues.

2. Open a web browser and go to the [lab files on GitHub](https://github.com/Kiran-255666/AgenticAIEngineer).

3. On the repository page, select the green **`<> Code`** button, and then select **Download ZIP**.

4. Once the download finishes, extract the ZIP file

5. Open ****PowerShell**** and run the following two commands to avoid long path issues:

```powershell
Copy-Item "C:\Users\agenticuser\Downloads\AgenticAIEngineer-main\AgenticAIEngineer-main\labfiles\Day05\lab01-agent-custom-tools" "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\lab01-agent-custom-tools" -Recurse

code "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\lab01-agent-custom-tools"
```

The first command copies the lab folder to your ****Desktop****, and the second command opens the copied folder directly in ****Visual Studio Code****.

This folder already contains the application files and the required code for this exercise.

> ****Note:**** The `agent.py` and `functions.py` files have already been updated with the implementation required for this exercise. You do not need to enter the code manually again. However, we recommend reviewing the code to understand each section before running the application.

7. You are now working from the ****Desktop**** folder, so there is no need to worry about the long path issue. Press ****Ctrl+Shift+`**** to open the integrated terminal.

8. In the terminal, enter the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:

   ```
   python -m venv labenv
   .\labenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

9. The ****.env**** file is already configured for you. You do not need to change any of the existing values.

> ****Tip:**** In general, if the ****.env**** file is not configured, you can use the previously installed ****Azure AI Foundry**** extension to get the required values. The **project endpoint** can be copied from the project deployment resource in the ****Foundry Toolkit**** extension in Visual Studio Code. You may need to do this in upcoming labs or when setting up your own projects in the future.

You are now ready to review and run an AI agent that uses custom function tools.

## Review the functions used by the agent

The required functions have already been added to **`functions.py`**. Review the file before running the application.

The file contains three functions:

* `next_visible_event()` — finds the next astronomical event visible from a specified location.
* `calculate_observation_cost()` — calculates telescope observation costs based on telescope tier, duration, and priority.
* `generate_observation_report()` — generates a summary of an astronomical observation.

### `next_visible_event`

The implementation is:

```python
# Determine the next visible astronomical event for a given location
def next_visible_event(location: str) -> str:
    """Returns the next visible astronomical event for a location."""

    today = int(datetime.now().strftime("%m%d"))
    loc = location.lower().replace(" ", "_")

    for name, event_type, date, date_str, locs in EVENTS:
        if loc in locs and date >= today:
            return json.dumps({
                "event": name,
                "type": event_type,
                "date": date_str,
                "visible_from": sorted(locs)
            })

    return json.dumps({
        "message": f"No upcoming events found for {location}."
    })
```

This function searches the sample astronomical event data and returns the next event visible from the specified location as a JSON string.

### `calculate_observation_cost`

The implementation is:

```python
# Calculate the cost of an astronomical observation
def calculate_observation_cost(
    telescope_tier: str,
    hours: float,
    priority: str
) -> str:
    """Calculate telescope observation cost."""

    tier_rates = {
        "standard": 100,
        "advanced": 200,
        "premium": 350
    }

    priority_multipliers = {
        "low": 0.8,
        "normal": 1.0,
        "high": 1.5
    }

    tier = telescope_tier.lower()
    priority_level = priority.lower()

    if tier not in tier_rates:
        return json.dumps({
            "error": f"Unknown telescope tier: {telescope_tier}"
        })

    if priority_level not in priority_multipliers:
        return json.dumps({
            "error": f"Unknown priority level: {priority}"
        })

    base_cost = tier_rates[tier] * hours
    total_cost = base_cost * priority_multipliers[priority_level]

    return json.dumps({
        "telescope_tier": telescope_tier,
        "hours": hours,
        "priority": priority,
        "cost": total_cost
    })
```

This function calculates the observation cost by combining the telescope's hourly rate with the priority multiplier.

### `generate_observation_report`

The implementation is:

```python
# Generate an observation report
def generate_observation_report(
    event_name: str,
    location: str,
    telescope_tier: str,
    hours: float,
    priority: str,
    observer_name: str
) -> str:
    """Generate a summary report for an astronomical observation."""

    return json.dumps({
        "event_name": event_name,
        "location": location,
        "telescope_tier": telescope_tier,
        "hours": hours,
        "priority": priority,
        "observer_name": observer_name,
        "status": "Observation report generated successfully"
    })
```

This function receives the observation details and returns them as a JSON-formatted report.

> **Important**: The functions have already been added to `functions.py`. Review the implementation rather than adding the functions manually.

## Review the Foundry project connection

Open **`agent.py`** and review the imports and project connection.

The required imports have already been added:

```python
import os
import json
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Add references
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition, FunctionTool
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential
from openai.types.responses.response_input_param import (
    FunctionCallOutput,
    ResponseInputParam,
)

from functions import (
    next_visible_event,
    calculate_observation_cost,
    generate_observation_report,
)
```

Notice that the three functions from `functions.py` are imported so they can be executed when the agent requests the corresponding function tools.

The application loads the project configuration from `.env`:

```python
load_dotenv()
project_endpoint = os.getenv("PROJECT_ENDPOINT")
model_deployment = os.getenv("MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME")
```

The application then connects to the Foundry project using `AzureCliCredential`:

```python
# Connect to the project client
with (
    AzureCliCredential() as credential,
    AIProjectClient(
        endpoint=project_endpoint,
        credential=credential
    ) as project_client,
    project_client.get_openai_client() as openai_client,
):
```

> **Note**: The application uses `AzureCliCredential`, so make sure you authenticate with Azure CLI before running the application.

## Review the function tools

The three function tools have already been defined in **`agent.py`**.

### Event function tool

```python
# Define the event function tool
event_tool = FunctionTool(
    name="next_visible_event",
    description="Get the next visible event in a given location.",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "continent to find the next visible event in "
                    "(e.g. 'north_america', 'south_america', 'australia')"
                ),
            },
        },
        "required": ["location"],
        "additionalProperties": False,
    },
    strict=True,
)
```

### Observation cost function tool

```python
# Define the observation cost function tool
cost_tool = FunctionTool(
    name="calculate_observation_cost",
    description=(
        "Calculate the cost of an observation based on the "
        "telescope tier, number of hours, and priority level."
    ),
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "telescope_tier": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "the tier of the telescope "
                    "(e.g. 'standard', 'advanced', 'premium')"
                ),
            },
            "hours": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "the number of hours for the observation",
            },
            "priority": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "the priority level of the observation "
                    "(e.g. 'low', 'normal', 'high')"
                ),
            },
        },
        "required": [
            "telescope_tier",
            "hours",
            "priority",
        ],
        "additionalProperties": False,
    },
    strict=True,
)
```

### Observation report function tool

```python
# Define the observation report generation function tool
report_tool = FunctionTool(
    name="generate_observation_report",
    description="Generate a report summarizing an astronomical observation",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "event_name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "the name of the astronomical event being observed"
                ),
            },
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "the location of the observer",
            },
            "telescope_tier": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "the tier of the telescope used for the observation "
                    "(e.g. 'standard', 'advanced', 'premium')"
                ),
            },
            "hours": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": (
                    "the number of hours the telescope was used "
                    "for the observation"
                ),
            },
            "priority": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "the priority level of the observation "
                    "(e.g. 'low', 'normal', 'high')"
                ),
            },
            "observer_name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "the name of the person who conducted the observation"
                ),
            },
        },
        "required": [
            "event_name",
            "location",
            "telescope_tier",
            "hours",
            "priority",
            "observer_name",
        ],
        "additionalProperties": False,
    },
    strict=True,
)
```

> **Important**: These tool definitions are already present in `agent.py`. Review the JSON schema for each tool to understand how the agent supplies arguments to the Python functions.

## Review the agent creation

The application creates an astronomy agent using the three function tools:

```python
# Create a new agent with the function tools
agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
    agent_name="astronomy-agent",
    definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
        model=model_deployment,
        instructions="""
        You are an astronomy observations assistant that helps users find
        information about astronomical events and calculate telescope rental costs.
        Use the available tools to assist users with their inquiries.
        """,
        tools=[
            event_tool,
            cost_tool,
            report_tool,
        ],
    ),
)
```

The agent is configured with:

* The deployed model specified by `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
* Instructions describing its role.
* Three custom function tools.

> **Important**: The agent creation code has already been added. Review it before executing the application.

## Review the conversation and function-call flow

The application creates a conversation:

```python
# Create a conversation for the chat session
conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()
```

A list is also created to hold function-call outputs:

```python
# Create a list to hold function call outputs
input_list: ResponseInputParam = []
```

When the user enters a prompt, it is added to the conversation:

```python
# Send a prompt to the agent
openai_client.conversations.items.create(
    conversation_id=conversation.id,
    items=[
        {
            "type": "message",
            "role": "user",
            "content": user_input,
        }
    ],
)
```

The application then retrieves the agent's response:

```python
# Retrieve the agent's response
response = openai_client.responses.create(
    conversation=conversation.id,
    extra_body={
        "agent_reference": {
            "name": agent.name,
            "type": "agent_reference",
        }
    },
    input=input_list,
)

# Check the run status for failures
if response.status == "failed":
    print(f"Response failed: {response.error}")
```

## Review function-call processing

When the model requests a function, the application identifies the requested function and executes the corresponding Python function:

```python
# Process function calls
for item in response.output:

    if item.type == "function_call":

        result = None

        if item.name == "next_visible_event":
            result = next_visible_event(
                **json.loads(item.arguments)
            )

        elif item.name == "calculate_observation_cost":
            result = calculate_observation_cost(
                **json.loads(item.arguments)
            )

        elif item.name == "generate_observation_report":
            result = generate_observation_report(
                **json.loads(item.arguments)
            )

        input_list.append(
            FunctionCallOutput(
                type="function_call_output",
                call_id=item.call_id,
                output=result,
            )
        )
```

The function output is then sent back to the agent:

```python
# Send function call outputs back to the model
if input_list:

    response = openai_client.responses.create(
        input=input_list,
        previous_response_id=response.id,
        extra_body={
            "agent_reference": {
                "name": agent.name,
                "type": "agent_reference",
            }
        },
    )

# Display the agent's response
print(f"AGENT: {response.output_text}")
```

This creates the following flow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Prompt] --> B[AI Agent]
    B --> C[Function Call]
    C --> D[Python Function]
    D --> E[Function Result]
    E --> F[AI Agent Processes Result]
    F --> G[Final Response]
```

> **Important**: All of this functionality has already been implemented in `agent.py`. Review the code and understand how the function-call cycle works before running the application.


## Run the agent application

1. In the integrated terminal, verify that your Azure credentials are authenticated:

   ```powershell
   az account show
   ```

   You should see your Azure account and subscription details.

   > **Tip:** If your Azure credentials are not displayed, run the following commands and try again:

   ```powershell
   az logout
   az login
   az account show
   ```

2. Make sure the virtual environment is activated:

   ```
   .\labenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```
   python agent.py
   ```

4. The application will create the agent and display a prompt similar to:

   ```text
   Enter a prompt for the astronomy agent. Use 'quit' to exit.
   USER:
   ```

5. Enter a prompt such as:

   ```
   Find me the next event I can see from South America and give me the cost for 5 hours of premium telescope time at normal priority.
   ```

   This prompt asks the agent to use both `next_visible_event` and `calculate_observation_cost`.

   The agent should invoke the appropriate function tools, process their results, and return a response.

   > **Tip**: The initial startup may take some time because the application connects to Azure and creates the agent in the Foundry project.

   > **Tip**: If the application fails because the rate limit is exceeded, wait a few seconds and try again. If there is insufficient model quota in your subscription, the model may not be able to respond.

6. Enter a follow-up prompt to generate an observation report, such as:

   ```
   Generate that information in a report for Bellows College.
   ```

   The agent should use the `generate_observation_report` function and return the generated report information.

7. Review the response returned by the agent.

8. Enter:

   ```
   quit
   ```

   to exit the application.

9. The application deletes the agent version before exiting:

   ```python
   # Delete the agent when done
   project_client.agents.delete_version(
       agent_name=agent.name,
       agent_version=agent.version,
   )

   print("Deleted agent.")
   ```

10. You can also use the following command to deactivate the Python virtual environment:

```
deactivate
```

> **Note**: The application files in this exercise have already been updated with the complete implementation. The purpose of these sections is to help you review and understand the implementation rather than requiring you to manually re-enter the code.

## Review the results

After running the application, verify that:

- The astronomy agent is created successfully.
- The agent can identify the appropriate function tool based on the user's prompt.
- `next_visible_event` returns the next visible astronomical event.
- `calculate_observation_cost` calculates the telescope observation cost.
- `generate_observation_report` generates the observation report details.
- The function results are returned to the agent and incorporated into the final response.
- The application exits successfully when you enter `quit`.
- The agent version is deleted when the application exits.

The overall function-calling flow is:

## Summary

In this exercise, you reviewed how to create an Azure AI agent with custom function tools. The application:

* Connects to an Azure AI Foundry project.
* Defines custom Python functions as agent tools.
* Creates an agent with multiple function tools.
* Sends user prompts to the agent.
* Processes function calls requested by the agent.
* Executes the corresponding Python functions.
* Sends the function results back to the agent.
* Displays the agent's final response.
* Deletes the agent version when the application exits.

You have now completed the custom function tools workflow and can use the same pattern to extend an AI agent with additional application-specific functionality.

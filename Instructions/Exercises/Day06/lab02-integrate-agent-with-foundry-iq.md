# Integrate an AI agent with Foundry IQ

**Note: We have already updated the mentioned files with the code mentioned in the instructions, but we would highly suggest going through it before executing it**

In this exercise, you'll configure an AI agent that uses Foundry IQ to search and retrieve information from a knowledge base. You'll use your existing Foundry project and deployed models, create a search resource and knowledge base with credit-risk assessment data, configure an agent, and then connect to it from Visual Studio Code.

This exercise should take approximately **45** minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your local machine
- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed
- An existing Foundry project with deployed chat and embedding models
- Basic familiarity with the Microsoft Foundry portal and Python programming

## Use your Foundry project and deployed models

This lab uses the Foundry project and deployed models that are already available to you. You don't need to create a new Foundry project or deploy a new model for this exercise.

1. In a web browser, open the [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in using your Azure credentials.
1. Select your existing Foundry project **(hakunamatata1)** from the project selector.
1. On the project home page, verify that **gpt-5.2** chat model and **text-embedding-3-small** embedding model are already deployed and available.
1. Keep the Foundry portal open. You'll use the existing chat model when creating the agent and knowledge base, and the existing embedding model when creating the knowledge source.

## Create an agent

Create an agent that will search the credit-risk knowledge base.

1. On the project home page, find the **Build an agent** card and select **Start building**.

2. Create an agent with a descriptive name, such as `credit-risk-assessment-agent-<unique_suffix>`, and set the **Interaction mode** to **Text**.

3. Select **Create**.

4. After the agent is created, the agent playground opens. You'll now configure the agent with credit-risk assessment information from Foundry IQ.


## Configure data and Foundry IQ

> ****Important:**** The following resource creation steps are ****optional****. We have already provisioned the required Azure AI Search and Storage Account resources for this lab, so you can skip these steps and use the provided resources. You can still go through these steps separately to explore and learn how these resources are created and configured.

First, add instructions to your agent. Then create a search resource, upload the credit-risk assessment documents, and create a knowledge base that connects those documents to the agent.

1. Give your agent the following instructions:

    ```
    You are a helpful AI assistant for credit-risk assessment.
    You must ALWAYS search the knowledge base to answer questions about the company documents,
    financial information, credit bureau information, and credit-risk assessment rules.
    Provide detailed, accurate information and always cite your sources.
    If you don't find relevant information in the knowledge base, say so clearly.
    ```

- Shareholders' Equity: 5,000,000
- Revenue: 9,000,000
- Net Profit: 500,000

The agent should successfully retrieve the required financial information from the connected Foundry IQ knowledge source.

---

#### Query 3

**Prompt**

```text
Retrieve the external credit bureau information for Apex Manufacturing Pvt Ltd from the connected knowledge source. Tell me the external credit bureau score, industry, and credit bureau status, and mention whether any adverse records are reported.
```

**Expected AI Response**

- External Credit Bureau Score: 720
- Industry: Manufacturing
- Credit Bureau Status: No adverse records reported
- Adverse Records Reported: No

The agent should successfully retrieve the credit bureau information from the connected Foundry IQ knowledge source and return the credit score, industry classification, credit bureau status, and adverse record details.

1. In the agent details page, copy the following information to a notepad. You'll use these values when configuring the client application:

    - **Agent name**: The name you created, such as `credit-risk-assessment-agent-<unique_suffix>`
    - **Project endpoint**: Available from the project home page such as `https://hakunamatata11.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/hakunamatata`

# Connect to your agent from an app

Now that the agent and knowledge base work in the portal, use the provided Python application to communicate with the agent programmatically.

# Get the application files from GitHub

1. If you have already downloaded and extracted the repository in a previous lab, delete the existing ZIP file and the extracted folder. This will allow us to use the PowerShell commands in the following steps and help avoid long path issues.

2. Open a web browser and go to the [lab files on GitHub](https://github.com/Kiran-255666/AgenticAIEngineer).

3. On the repository page, select the green **`<> Code`** button, and then select **Download ZIP**.

4. Once the download finishes, extract the ZIP file.

5. Open ****PowerShell**** and run the following two commands to avoid long path issues:

```powershell
Copy-Item "C:\Users\agenticuser\Downloads\AgenticAIEngineer-main\AgenticAIEngineer-main\labfiles\Day06\lab02-integrate-agent-with-foundry-iq" "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\lab02-integrate-agent-with-foundry-iq" -Recurse

code "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\lab02-integrate-agent-with-foundry-iq"
```

The first command copies the lab folder to your ****Desktop****, and the second command opens the copied folder directly in ****Visual Studio Code****.

This folder already contains the application files and the required code for this exercise.

6. You are now working from the ****Desktop**** folder, so there is no need to worry about the long path issue. Press ****Ctrl+Shift+`**** to open the integrated terminal.

7. In the terminal, enter the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:

   ```
   python -m venv labenv
   .\labenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. Configure the environment variables
Open the **`.env`** file from the side panel and fill in the following:

    ```
    PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://hakunamatata11.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/hakunamatata
    AGENT_NAME=credit-risk-assessment-agent-<your_suffix>
    ```
    
Replace `<your_suffix>` with the unique suffix you used when creating the agent.

## Review the agent client code

The required client code has already been added to **`agent_client.py`**. Review the file before running the application.

The client connects to the existing Microsoft Foundry agent, creates a conversation, sends user questions to the agent, and displays the responses returned from the connected Foundry IQ knowledge source.

### Load the configuration

The application loads the project endpoint and agent name from the `.env` file:

```python
load_dotenv()

project_endpoint = os.getenv("PROJECT_ENDPOINT")
agent_name = os.getenv("AGENT_NAME")
```

The client checks that both values are available before connecting to the Foundry project.

### Connect to the Foundry project

The client uses `DefaultAzureCredential` to authenticate and `AIProjectClient` to connect to the existing Foundry project:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential(
    exclude_environment_credential=True,
    exclude_managed_identity_credential=True
)

project_client = AIProjectClient(
    credential=credential,
    endpoint=project_endpoint
)
```

### Connect to the agent

The client retrieves the existing agent using the agent name configured in `.env`:

```python
agent = project_client.agents.get(
    agent_name=agent_name
)

print(f"Connected to: {agent.name}")
```

This allows the Python application to send questions to the agent that was configured with Foundry IQ.

### Create a conversation

The client creates a conversation for the current session:

```python
conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()
```

The same conversation is used for the questions entered during the session.

### `send_message_to_agent`

The `send_message_to_agent()` function sends the user's question to the connected Foundry agent:

```python
def send_message_to_agent(user_message):
    response = openai_client.responses.create(
        conversation=conversation.id,
        extra_body={
            "agent_reference": {
                "name": agent.name,
                "type": "agent_reference"
            }
        },
        input=user_message
    )

    print("\nAgent:")
    print(response.output_text)
```

The user's question is sent to the agent using the Responses API. The agent can use the connected Foundry IQ knowledge source to retrieve relevant information before generating its response.

The returned response is then displayed in the terminal.

### `main`

The `main()` function provides the command-line interface:

```python
def main():
    while True:
        try:
            user_input = input("\nYou: ").strip()

            if not user_input:
                continue

            if user_input.lower() in {"quit", "exit"}:
                print("\nConversation ended.")
                break

            send_message_to_agent(user_input)

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\n\nConversation ended.")
            break

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\nError: {str(e)}")
```

You can continue asking questions during the same conversation.

To stop the application, enter **`quit`**, enter **`exit`**, or press **Ctrl+C**.

## Test the integration

1. In the integrated terminal, verify that you are signed in to Azure:

```powershell

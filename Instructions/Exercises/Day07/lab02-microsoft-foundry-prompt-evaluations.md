# Microsoft Foundry Prompt Evaluations

Microsoft Foundry provides evaluation capabilities to help you assess the quality, reliability, and safety of generative AI responses. Using dataset-based evaluations, you can measure responses against evaluation criteria such as relevance, coherence, and safety. Reviewing these evaluation results can help you identify areas for improvement in prompts, datasets, and model configuration before using a generative AI solution in a real-world or production scenario.

In this exercise, you'll explore how to create a dataset-based evaluation in Microsoft Foundry, configure the evaluation scope and criteria, and review the results.

This exercise will take approximately **25** minutes.

## Prerequisites

To complete this exercise, you need:

- Active Azure subscription.
- Access to Microsoft Foundry.
- Permission to use or deploy the required model.
- Prepared JSONL dataset for evaluation.
- Browser access to the Microsoft Foundry portal.

# Open Azure AI Foundry

1. Open Microsoft Edge.

2. Go to the **Microsoft Foundry portal**: https://ai.azure.com/

3. Sign in using the provided credentials if you haven’t logged in before or if you have logged out.

4. By default, it should take you to the `hakunamatata1` project's home page.

   <summary>If you are not redirected to the project</summary>

   Click **Select the project**, choose `hakunamatata1`, and you will be redirected to the project's home page.

   </details>


## Go to Evaluation

1. From the project's **home page**, click the **Build** tab on the top-right menu.

2. From the left navigation pane, select **Evaluation**.

3. Click **Create** to create a new evaluation.

4. Select **Target: Dataset** and click **Upload new dataset**.

6. On the **Dataset** page, click **Upload new dataset** in the top-right corner.

7. In the **Upload new dataset** dialog, enter a name for the dataset, such as `credit-risk-prompt-evaluation-<your_unique_prefix>`.

8. Upload the downloaded JSONL dataset and click **Upload**.

9. After the dataset is uploaded, click **Next**.

## Select Evaluation Scope

1. In the **Scope** section, verify that **Individual turns** is selected by default. The current dataset contains separate question-and-response pairs, so each response can be evaluated independently.

| Option                 | Use When                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Individual turns**   | The dataset contains separate question-and-response pairs, with each response evaluated independently. |
| **Full conversations** | The dataset contains complete multi-turn conversations with multiple back-and-forth messages.          |

2. Click **Next**

## Criteria

1. In the **Criteria** section, observer the evaluators that are auto suggested to assess the dataset responses. 
1. Click **Next**.

## Review & Submit the Evaluation

1. For **Evaluation name** provide a meaningful evaluation name.
2. Click Submit.

## Review Evaluation Results

1. Refresh the evaluation status if needed and wait till **Status** turns form **In progress** to **Completed**
2. Open the completed evaluation run.
3. Review the scores, metrics, reasoning, and detailed data view.
4. Use the results to identify where prompt, model, or dataset improvements are required.

## Conclusion

In this exercise, you used a JSONL file in Microsoft Foundry to evaluate generative AI responses. You configured a dataset-based evaluation, selected the appropriate evaluation scope, reviewed the available evaluators, submitted the evaluation run, and reviewed the results.

In real-world scenarios, evaluation data may be provided in different formats, such as CSV, JSON, or other supported formats. While the input format may vary, the core evaluation process remains the same: prepare the data, configure the evaluation, run it, and review the results to identify areas for improvement.
